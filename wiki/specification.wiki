#summary Specification for vim-vhdl plugin
#labels Phase-Requirements


= Introduction =

Designing components with VHDL language is very verbose. Then lot of declaration and connections can done automatically with a great editor and this plugin. Unfortunately only Emacs has a good plugin to write VHDL code it's bad. 

To correct this, the goal of vim-vhdl is to provide a better plugin than emacs-vhdl mode because nothing can be better than vim ;-)
