#summary Specification for vim-vhdl plugin
#labels Phase-Requirements


= Introduction =

Designing components with VHDL language is very verbose. Then lot of declaration and connections can done automatically with a great editor and this plugin. Unfortunately only Emacs has a good plugin to write VHDL code ... it's bad. 

To correct this, the goal of vim-vhdl is to provide a better plugin than emacs-vhdl mode because nothing can be better than vim ;-) 

= Details =

The main features of this plugin are :

 * indent beautifully the code with ":" and "=>" aligned.
 * when component is instanced, automatically copy all signal interface loaded from the wright file.
